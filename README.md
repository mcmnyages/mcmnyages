**🎯 CTF & Cybersecurity Practice:**  
I regularly participate in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions to strengthen my cybersecurity skills. These challenges help me stay sharp with penetration testing, reverse engineering, cryptography, and web exploitation techniques — all essential for building more secure applications.

## 🤝 Contributing

I welcome collaboration and feedback. A few guidelines to make contributions smooth:

- Branches: use `feature/<name>` or `fix/<name>`  
- Commits: write clear, imperative commit messages (e.g., "Add authentication module")  
- PRs: target `main`, include a description, link to related issues, and steps to test  
- Tests: add tests where possible and follow linting rules

Open an issue or PR — I try to respond promptly.

## 🔒 Security Practices

Security is central to my work:

- 🚫 Never commit secrets or `.env` files — use environment variables and GitHub Secrets.  
- 🔐 Sanitize and validate all inputs; avoid unsafe deserialization.  
- 🧹 Use sample or anonymized data in public repos.  
- 🔍 Document known limitations and encourage responsible disclosure for vulnerabilities.
- 🎯 Continuously improve security knowledge through CTF competitions and hands-on practice.

If you discover a security issue, please contact me directly via email before public disclosure.
