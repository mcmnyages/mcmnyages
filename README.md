🤝 Contributing
I’d love to collaborate! Here’s how to contribute:  

Branching: feature/<short-name> or fix/<short-name>  
Commits: Use imperative tense (e.g., "Add login button")  
Pull Requests: Target main (or develop), include description and testing steps.  
Tests & Linting: Add tests where feasible; ensure lint rules pass.

Got ideas? Open an issue, and I’ll review it promptly.

🔒 Security & Secrets
Security is my priority:  

🚫 Never commit: .env files, API keys, keystores, or credentials.  
🔐 Use GitHub Secrets: For CI/CD and signing keys.  
🧹 Sanitized Data: Only use sample data in public repos.
