## 🎯 CTF & Cybersecurity Practice

I actively participate in Capture The Flag competitions to maintain and expand my cybersecurity expertise. These challenges keep me current with:

- 🔓 **Penetration Testing:** Web app vulnerabilities, privilege escalation, lateral movement
- 🔍 **Reverse Engineering:** Binary analysis, malware dissection, code deobfuscation
- 🔐 **Cryptography:** Classical ciphers to modern cryptographic attacks
- 🌐 **Web Exploitation:** SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, authentication bypass
- 🖥️ **Binary Exploitation:** Buffer overflows, ROP chains, heap exploitation

These skills directly inform my secure coding practices and threat modeling approaches in production applications.

## 🔒 Security Philosophy

Security isn't a feature—it's a foundation. Here's how I approach it:

### Core Principles

- **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege:** Minimal access rights for users and systems
- **Secure by Default:** Security baked into design, not bolted on later
- **Fail Securely:** Systems should fail in a safe state
- **Keep It Simple:** Complex systems are harder to secure

### Best Practices I Follow

```yaml
Code Security:
  - Input Validation: Sanitize and validate all user inputs
  - Output Encoding: Prevent injection attacks
  - Authentication: Strong password policies, MFA where possible
  - Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC)
  - Cryptography: Industry-standard algorithms, proper key management
  
Development Process:
  - Secret Management: Never commit credentials or API keys
  - Dependency Scanning: Regular updates and vulnerability checks
  - Code Reviews: Security-focused peer review process
  - Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, security tests
  - Documentation: Clear security documentation and threat models
  
Operations:
  - Logging & Monitoring: Comprehensive audit trails
  - Incident Response: Prepared for security events
  - Updates: Regular patching and maintenance
  - Backups: Encrypted, tested backup procedures
```

### 🚨 Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of my projects:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email me directly at [morachasilas@gmail.com](mailto:morachasilas@gmail.com)
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

I take security seriously and will respond promptly to legitimate reports.
